# nodehands

NodeHands adds osc to a handtracking sketch from [Creativeguru97](https://github.com/Creativeguru97) - [original code](https://github.com/Creativeguru97/YouTube_tutorial/tree/master/Play_with_APIs/hand_detection/mediapipe_hands/final)

This modification uses node to create a server that sends osc messages from the P5 sketch - xy positions of each trcked hand point. 

### Steps 

1. make sure node is installed. If not installed download and install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. in the terminal cd to nodehands directory (unzip the folder first, your directory should look like the image below)

3. run the bridge.js file

4. open the index.html file, select a camera. Once this webpage is running sucessfully the terminal should update say "connection"

5. you can now read the osc data in other platforms - osc data is broadcasting on port 3334 (example of how to read port 3334 in TouchDesigner using the oscin chop)

Note:
The point data comes in at x,y coordinates relative to the p5js canvas - 640 * 480. If desired it can be mapped to a usable range in the sketch.js file or by mapping in other software e.g TD, MaxMSP using math and scale objects.  
Simple TD and Max examples are attached - the mapping of the points to hand in the TD is a little funky so it may need some remapping

For folks that are new to OSC here's a useful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcqC5rRmu3M) on sending signals between TD and Max using OSC
