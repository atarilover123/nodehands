NodeHands adds osc to a handtrackign sketch from [Creativeguru97](https://github.com/Creativeguru97) - [original code](https://github.com/Creativeguru97/YouTube_tutorial/tree/master/Play_with_APIs/hand_detection/mediapipe_hands/final)

This modification uses node to create a server that sends osc messages from the P5 sketch - xy positions of each trcked hand point. 

### Steps 

1. make sure node is installed. If not installed download and install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. in the terminal cd to nodehands directory (unzip the folder first, the folder should contain)
